You’ll learn frameworks to develop an effective listening approach, engage teams, cultivate accountability, and transform your company’s culture. You’ll also gain the tactical skills to apply everything you’ve learned. Having recognized credentials from the market-leading CX company will set you apart in your organization, and in your career.

        <p class="lead col-sm-9 col-md-6 m-5 p-5">I love helping big companies stay close to their customers. I grew up in a family business where our customers and co-workers were often family friends, so I guess I'm wired to care what customers think. The best part is seeing how a focus on customers translates to the bottom line. Teams work smarter and companies adapt faster when they have feedback at their fingertips.</p>
